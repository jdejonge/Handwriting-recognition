HOW TO RUN THE EXPERIMENT?
Create photos that are black lines on white and squared and put them in the Photos/1 folder. If that's not present create such folders.
If the file EMNIST_letter_model.h5 is not in folder saved_model then you first have to Creating_model.py . If there's an error look if saved_model folder is present, if so you have to delete it.
If the file EMNIST_letter_model.h5 eventually is in folder saved_model you can run Getting_prediction_data.py .

HOW TO SEE THE PREVIOUS RESULTS OF THE PAPER?
In the folder Results you can find the several Excel files with all the data. The Excel file Combined_statistics.xlsb has the diagrams used for the paper.
